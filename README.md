## ✨ Overview

The **F1-ML-Project** is a machine learning-based tool designed to analyze and extract meaningful insights from Formula 1 racing data between 2018 and 2023.

### 🎯 Project Goals:

- 🧩 **Unsupervised Learning**: Cluster F1 drivers based on performance similarity across multiple races and seasons.
- 🎯 **Supervised Learning**: Predict individual driver performance in upcoming races using past metrics.

To achieve this, the project utilizes structured race data via the FastF1 API. The dataset includes telemetry, weather, timing, and event information from real F1 race weekends.

### 🧠 Key Benefits:

- 🔍 **Data-Driven Analysis**: Go beyond basic stats by using ML to detect patterns across seasons.
- 🏎️ **Race Strategy Insights**: Understand what separates consistent podium drivers from the rest.
- 📉 **Predictive Power**: Anticipate race-day outcomes with model-based forecasts.
- 📁 **Reliable Data Pipeline**: FastF1 caching system is enabled to prevent redundant data downloads.
- 📓 **Hands-On Jupyter Notebooks**: Work through all steps — from preprocessing to model training — interactively.
